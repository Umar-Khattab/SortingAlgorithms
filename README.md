# Sorting Algorithms Library

This repository contains a collection of sorting algorithms implemented in C#. These algorithms are designed to demonstrate various sorting techniques, including simple sorting, bubble sort, selection sort, insertion sort, merge sort, bucket sort, and count sort.

## Features

- **SimpleSort**: A basic sorting algorithm that sorts an array in ascending order.
- **ReverseSimpleSort**: Sorts an array in descending order.
- **BubbleSort**: A classic sorting algorithm that repeatedly swaps adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order.
- **SelectionSort**: Selects the smallest element from the unsorted part of the array and swaps it with the first element.
- **InsertionSort**: Builds the sorted array one element at a time by inserting elements into their correct position.
- **MergeSort**: A divide-and-conquer algorithm that splits the array into halves, sorts them recursively, and merges them back.
- **BucketSort**: Sorts an array by distributing elements into buckets and sorting each bucket.
- **CountSort**: Counts the occurrences of each element and reconstructs the sorted array.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
2. Open the solution in Visual Studio 2022.

## Usage

### Example: Using BubbleSort
You can use the sorting algorithms in your project by calling the static methods in the `Algorithms` class.


### Available Methods
- `SimpleSort(int[] nums)`
- `ReverseSimpleSort(int[] nums)`
- `BubbleSort(int[] nums)`
- `SelectionSort(int[] arr)`
- `InsertionSort(int[] arr)`
- `MergeSort(int[] arr)`
- `BucketSort(int[] arr)`
- `CountSort(int[] arr)`
